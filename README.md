Came to acquire on of these:

[AVR Adaptor Board for KC-5340 Kit Back Catalogue](https://www.jaycar.com.au/avr-adaptor-board-for-kc-5340-kit-back-catalogue/p/KC5421)

Ours had the zero-insertion terminals installed.

Perfect for programming attiny85.

Still need an AVR ISP programmer. I bought a [USBAsp](https://core-electronics.com.au/usbasp-usbisp-3-3v-5v-avr-programmer.html)

The 10-pin connector on the jaycar/silicon chip board is standard 10-pin ISP header

The attiny85 slots exactly at the top of SK1 (with Jumpers J2 and J3 shorted)
